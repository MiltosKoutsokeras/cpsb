Out of the team of 40 working on Street Fighter 2, 20 were artists working on character designs, faces and backgrounds. All of them reported to Akira Yasuda<ref src="https://www.polygon.com/a/street-fighter-2-oral-history/chapter-2">Street Fighter 2: An oral history</ref>.

<h2>Combo accident</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>
  The combo was an accident. While I was making a bug check during the car bonus stage, I noticed that with a certain timing, I was able to add as second punch to the first one.
</p>
<p>
  I thought this was something impossible to make useful inside a game. Additionally, I though the timing was too hard to catch. In the end, I decided to leave it as a hidden feature.
