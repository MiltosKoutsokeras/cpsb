No vacations:
<blockquote>
  We had vacation days, but Okamoto would get mad if you took the day off. A lot of people got yelled at by him for that, “Hey, why weren’t you here on Sunday?!”

  I don’t think anyone can beat my record for “percentage of time lived at Capcom.” During game developments, I always slept under my desk. I had a whole futon laid out and everything! When things were really busy, Yoshiki Okamoto (former Capcom development leader) would be setting new deadlines every 10 hours, so I couldn’t leave my computer… that’s how I acquired the habit of sleeping under my desk. By the way, even now that I’m freelance, I still sleep under my computer desk at home.

Out of the team of 40 working on Street Fighter 2, 20 were artists working on character designs, faces and backgrounds. All of them reported to Akira Yasuda<ref src="https://www.polygon.com/a/street-fighter-2-oral-history/chapter-2">Street Fighter 2: An oral history</ref>.

<h2>Combo accident</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>
  The combo was an accident. While I was making a bug check during the car bonus stage, I noticed that with a certain timing, I was able to add as second punch to the first one.
</p>
<p>
  I thought this was something impossible to make useful inside a game. Additionally, I though the timing was too hard to catch. In the end, I decided to leave it as a hidden feature.
