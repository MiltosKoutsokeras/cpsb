\chapter{Forewords}

Some video-games are so well done, they feel like magic tricks.

Faced with something seemingly impossible, some people will take away a fond memory but others will want to understand
how it works.

It may be argued that knowledge will destroy the illusion or at the very least lessen the experience. But for people like me, it takes the amazement one step further. Taking a look behind the curtain only commands more respect towards the magician. Knowing, after the fact, is a celebration that makes me respect the artist even more.

Being in the shoes of Oz forces us to see the somewhat convoluted gears and cables moving that giant head. But it is an opportunity to also understand how hard it is to get it right, the countless details, the innumerable hours of practice, the imagination required, in one word, the dedication it took which inevitably develop an appreciation for their craft.


Of course these people got paid for their work. We purchased our ticket for the show (these quarter angry machine left us no choice anyway). But when some of them took it much further than their salary mandated their hard work resulted in \emph{prestige-ious} titles.

Video-games such as the one experienced by enthusiasts in the arcades of the mid-90s were magic. They did something players could not experience at home. Players' hearts raced and eyes sparkled. They took us to another world. The experience was re-inforced by the effort it took to get access to arcade games. 

Players of this era did not fly to Vegas but they had to make numerous arrangement to get there. Quarters had to be gathered,  means of transportation acquired, and paper maps studied, often to land in a dirty bar surrounded by adults whom did not seem to have much wizardry happening in their lives. But what a reward to see Capcom rivaling with SNK for our attention. 

As we are about to discover how the rabbit came out of the hat, I hope readers will enjoy the ride but more importantly I hope the story of the CPS-1 will inspire them as much as it has inspired me.

In every aspect of our lives, by combining dedication and consideration we can make this world a better place. 

We can all be magicians.
