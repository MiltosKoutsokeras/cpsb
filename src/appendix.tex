\section{Making of}

This books was written for the most part on a Lenovo X1 Carbon Gen 9 running Ubuntu 22.04. It was a deeply enjoyable experience to work with such a reliable and blazing fast machine.

A few excursion into Windows 10 territories happened to use Adobe Photoshop when Gimp skills showed their limits. 

Source code was synchronized via the awesome Github. \LaTeX\ was authored with Sublime Text 4. Drawing were done with Inkscape. Game screenshots captured with Mame. Compilation was performed by \texttt{pdflatex}.

The build system is a custom Golang program able to operate with a single \icode{build.go} command. It takes 1m53s to generate the whole PDF in release mode (300dpi). An incremental debug mode (100dpi) completes within 10s. 

The PDF viewer changed between platform. On Linux, \texttt{evince} was used while SumatraPDF was chosen on Windows. Both viewer were not only amazingly fast, they also supported auto-reload which was a life safer. Both there projects received handsome donations for their service.

To remain motivated to ship, a copious amount of moral support was provided by Rudy the cat and my amazing wife, Victoria Ho.
