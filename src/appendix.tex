\section{Making of}

This books was written for the most part on Lenovo Carbon Gen 9 running Ubuntu 22.04. It was a deeply enjoying experience to work with such a reliable and blazing fast machine. A few excursion into  Windows 10 territories happened to use Adobe Photoshop when my Gimp skills reached their limits. 

Source code was synchronized via the awesome Github. \LaTeX\ was authored with Sublime Text 4. Drawing were done with Inkscape. Game screenshots captured with Mame. Compilation was performed by \texttt{pdflatex}.

The build system is a custom Golang program able to generate the whole PDF incrementally in 2s (debug mode 100dpi) and 10s in release mode (300dpi). A fresh build takes respectively 22s and 30s.

The PDF viewer changed between platform. On Linux, evince was used while SumatraPDF was chosen on Windows. Both viewer were not only amazingly fast, they also supported auto-reload which was a life safer. Both there projects received handsome donations for their service.

To remain motivated to ship, a copious amount of moral support was provided by Rudy the cat and my amazing wife, Victoria Ho.
