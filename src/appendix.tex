\section{Making of}

This books was written alternatively on a Windows desktop PC and a Linux Lenovo Carbon Gen 9 depending on whether the author wanted to deal with \icode{modprobe} that day. Source code was synchronized via the awesome Github.

On both systems the tools used were the same. \LaTeX\ was authored with Sublime Text 4. Drawing were done with Inkscape. Game screenshot captured with Mame. Compilation was performed by Pdflatex.

The build system is a custom Golang program able to generate the whole PDF incremental in 2s (debug mode 100dpi) and 10s in release mode (300dpi). A fresh build takes respectively 22s and 30s.

Only PDF viewer changed between platform. On Linux, evince was used while SumatraPDF was chosen on Windows. Both viewer were not only amazingly fast, they also supported auto-reload which was a life safer. Both there projects received handsome donations for their service.

To remain motivate and ship it, a copious amount of moral support was provided by Rudy the cat and the care of my amazing wife, Victoria Ho.
