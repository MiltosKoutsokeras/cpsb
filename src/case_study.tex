\begin{q}{ninakira, Producer (Capcom)}
Back in the days of SF2, the arcade boards' specs weren't as good as they are today, and there was a limit to how many sprites could be displayed on screen at once. We carefully planned things out so that the biggest character and the second biggest character could just barely fit on screen at the same time. 

But when mirror matches became possible in Champion Edition, that meant that we had to be able to display two copies of the biggest character on screen. We ended up having to remove background elements and such.
