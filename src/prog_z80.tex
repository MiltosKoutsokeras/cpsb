\chapter{Sound System}
Making ROMs for the sound system is a little bit more complicated than for the GFX system. 

Not only samples and music assets are processed, there is also a need to compile code to bootstrap and then run the z80. This program is commonly called a "Sound Driver".

\begin{figure}[H]
\sdraw{1.0}{sound_arch}
\caption*{The Sound System components}
\end{figure}

The assets and the driver must be packed into two ROMS set, one called "z80 ROM" and another called "OKI ROM". This asymmetry where three system result in two ROM is further complicated by the dependency graph that looks like a plate of spaghetti. 

The difficult part is that both the sound effects and the music contribute to the OKI ROM content which must be populated in two steps.



\nbdraw{build_graph_sfx}

The structure of the OKI ROM facilitates the task since it features an index at the beginning which references all payloads. Leveraging it allows to have a first pass where audio samples are ingested by the build system to generate an incomplete OKI ROM. In a second pass, the music tracks are processed so the new samples are added to the index ROM and the payload appended.

At the very top, \icode{ccps\_sfx} expect artists to provide sound samples contained in \icode{.wav} files, a format which is universally supported by audio tools. This stage generates a partial OKI ROM and a \icode{.h} header file to be injected in the control build graph so the m68k can request samples playback with a simple ID.

The second stage involves \icode{ccps\_mus}, the music processor. It expects \icode{.vgm} (Video Game Music) as input. These contain raw 2151 instructions which are easy to convert. It outputs the final OKI ROM with the sample used by the soundtrack and also a \icode{.c} file including bytecode containing YM2151 register values, timing, and OKI sample timing.

The last stage relies on the Small Device C Compiler (SDCC) toolchain. All artifacts generated in the two previous stages are used as input on top of the programmer \icode{.c} files and the bootstrap \icode{crt0.s} assembled by \icode{sdasz80} assembler. In this step, all resulting relocatable object files \icode{.rel} are linked together via ssdc's linker \icode{sdldz80}. 


% \begin{trivia}
% These are a lot of step but if you use \icode{ccps} build system, it is all taken care of with one keystroke resulting in two ROM sets ready to go.
% \end{trivia}






\section{Processing Sound Samples}
A wav file is a simple container with a header describing the content followed by a payload. Once the sampling frequency, bit per sample, and number of channel is retrieved, the PCM can be accessed.

\subsection{Constraint}
Artists should not produce stereo wavs since the CPS-1 is mono. Moreover, game developers should decide if they wish to use the OKI in high quality (7575Hz) or low quality (6060Hz) and all assets should use that sampling rate. Finally, since ADPCM compressed 12-bit sample to 4-bit samples, artists should provide 16-bit wavs.


\subsection{ADPCM Compression}
\index{ADPCM!Compression}
% ADPCM is a simple way to compress PCM. In an era where every 1 KiB of ROM was precious, ADPCM was just a vessel allowing 50\% space saving. Upon usage, it is be decompressed by the OKI into PCM to drive a speaker cone.
Decompression is done in hardware by the OKI at runtime but the build system still have to compress assets appropriately. 

% The algorithm to convert PCM to "Dialogic ADPCM" is publicly available and extensively documented by OKI\cite{adpcm_specs}. It is as simple as the decompression algorithm visited in the hardware section on page \pageref{adpcm_decompression_label}.

ADPCM encodes the difference between the previous sample and the sample to be generated. Each 16-bit sample is encoded into a 4-bit nibble\cite{adpcm_specs}.


\lstinputlisting[style=CStyle]{src/code/adpcm_algo.c}


Let's take the example of a stream of 16-bit PCM values received from a wav to be compressed to 4-bit ADPCM values.

\lstinputlisting[style=CStyle]{src/code/pcm-dpcm.c}

\subsubsection{Compressing sample 1}
The first 16-bit sample has a value of \icode{960} which becomes \icode{60} in 12-bit. With the current step size at 16, ADPCM can only commands a delta of + ( 16 + 16/2 + 16/4) = +28 which it encodes in a nibble \icode{0b0111}. The step size index is updated via the the transitionTable to now point to 8 (value \icode{34})

\subsubsection{Compressing sample 2}
The second 16-bit sample also has a value of \icode{960} which becomes \icode{60} in 12-bit. Since the latest sample output was 28, ADPCM must somehow encode a difference of 60-28 = 32. ADPCM commands a delta of + ( 0 + 34/2 + 34/4) = +33 which it encodes in a nibble \icode{0b0011}. 

The decompressor will output 28 (its last value) + 33 = 61. It will slightly overshot the desired value but we can see how the step size has adapted to the delta requested with only two steps. 

Once again the step size index is updated via the transitionTable to 8 (previous value) -1 = 7, which equals 31.

\subsubsection{Compressing sample 3}
The third 16-bit sample has a value of \icode{950} which becomes \icode{56} in 12-bit. Since the latest sample output was 61, ADPCM encodes a difference of 56-61 = -5. ADPCM commands a delta of - (0 + 0 + 31/4) = -7 which it encodes in a nibble \icode{0b1001}. 

The decompressor will output 61 (its last value) - 5 = 56. The step size index is updated via the transitionTable to 7 (previous value) -1 = 6, which equals 28.

\subsubsection{Compressing sample 4}
The last 16-bit sample has a value of \icode{160} which becomes \icode{10} in 12-bit. Since the latest sample output was 56, ADPCM encodes a difference of 10-56 = -46. ADPCM commands a delta of - (28 + 28/2 + 0) = -42 which it encodes in a nibble \icode{0b1110}. 

The decompressor will output 56 (its last value) - 42 = 14. The step size index is updated via the transitionTable to 6 (previous value) + 6 = 12, which equals 50.

% The result is stored in four nibble which fit in an array of two bytes. 
Graphing PCM vs ADPCM shows that the decompressed stream "lags" behind upon abrupt changes but catches up aggressively. ADPCM first value is always near zero (+/-28) but it is not audible to players since most samples start with a faded-in. 

\nbdraw{adpcm_graphed}

\section{Structure of the OKI ROM}
The structure of the OKI is simple. It features 127 * 6 bytes table at its beginning. Each entry points to a payload in the ROM. The payload of each entry must be ADPCM stream.

For some reason offset 0 in the table index must not be used.

\lstinputlisting[style=CStyle]{src/code/okistruct.c}

Notice there is no metadata to indicate the bitrate. The "database" entry is a plain offset directly pointing to ADPCM nibbles. It is up to the build system to carry out this info to the z80. In practice Capcom games never mixed bitrate, and always used 7575Hz.

\section{Processing Musics}
Making music with FM synthesis is an art which this book does not intend to butcher. The best way to go is to ask the musicians in the team to work with whatever tool they wish (the amazing DefleMask is highly recommended) and export their symphonies using VGM file format.

The VGM (Video Game Music) is a community effort originating from \icode{smspower.org} to create an audio file format able to support many legacy systems (SEGA consoles, MSX, Neo Geo, and PC) as well as Arcade hardware.

The arcade profile is particularly interesting for the CPS-1 since it uses YM2151 for FM Synthesis and SegaPCM for the samples.

If the YM2151 is obviously a perfect fit that will need no processing, the SegaPCM need some adjustments. As a chip used by SEGA in their AM2 (Amusement Machine 2) from 1985 to 1991, it is superior in capabilities to the MSM6295. It relies on 16-bit PCM, up to 32kHZ sampling, has more channels. and a larger address space.

The build system can take care of compressing the PCM via ADPCM and resample from 32KHz to 8080Hz but it is imperative for the musician to use only two channels to play nicely with the CPS-1 where two channels will be used to play sound effects.


\lstinputlisting[style=CStyle]{src/code/z80/vgm.c}



\section{Programming the z80}
Programming Zilog's CPU into a sound driver involves doing two things right, bootstrapping and setup the memory map. Since the later is easier, it is discussed first. To avoid page turning, the requirements are reproduced here.

\begin{figure}[H]

  \toprule    
\end{tabularx}%
}\caption*{z80 memory map}
\end{figure}


Using \icode{sdcc} is helping a lot here since it features an exclusive "placement" keyword \icode{\_\_at}.

\lstinputlisting[style=CStyle]{src/code/z80/memory_map.c}

With the registers correctly mapped, what remains is to place the \icode{.text} and \icode{.data} at the right location in ROM. This can easily be done thanks to the awesome \icode{sdldz80} linker via a linker script.

\lstinputlisting[]{src/code/z80/main.lk}

As expected, the \icode{\_DATA} is placed at \icode{0xd000}. The \icode{\_CODE} however is placed not at \icode{0x0000} but \icode{0x0200} for reason that will follow soon.

\begin{trivia}
Trivia: Debugging a CPS-1 program can be a tedious task. A good starting point when encountering an issue is to read the linker \icode{.map} file which indicates where each symbol was placed.
\end{trivia}

\subsection{Bootstrapping}
A z80 starts fetching and executing instructions from \icode{0x0000}. The bootstrap code \icode{crt0.s} is placed accordingly there via \icode{.org 0}.

The code immediately jumps to \icode{0x100} in order to skip the interrupt handler. The z80 can work in interrupt modes 0, 1, or 2. Modes 0 and 2 are the most powerful and complex. They imply retrieving the id of the interrupting peripheral by reading a byte on the data bus. This mechanism allows support of multi-devices interruption. However in this case, it is overkill. The z80 uses Mode 1 and jumps to \icode{0x38} when interrupted.

At \icode{0x100}, the stack pointer \icode{sp} is set to point at the end of \icode{RAM} (the z80 stack grows downward), the first interrupt is requested and a mystery \icode{gsinit} function is called.

All the code in \icode{crt0.s} (on page \pageref{z80_crt0}) accounts for a few hundred bytes. Which explains why we requested the linker script to place \icode{\_CODE} further at \icode{0x200}.

In \icode{crt0.s} below, notice how C functions are prefixed with \icode{\_}.
\pagebreak

\lstinputlisting[style=Z80Style]{src/code/z80/crt0.s}
\label{z80_crt0}







\subsection{z80 interrupt}
In order to interact with the latches properly but also to be able to keep track of wall-time, the z80 needs to be interrupted regularly. Zilog's CPU does features a timer RFSH but it is intended for DRAM refresh (which the sound system does not feature anyway).

Instead the interrupts are triggered by the YM2151, thanks to its two internal timers. Timer A is a 10-bit counter while Timer B is an 8-bit counter. For a YM2151 at 3,579Hz, the trigger formula is 64 * (1024 - value) / 3579.

Setting the Timer A to \icode{800} will result in an interrupt 64 * (1024 - 800) / 3579 = 4ms later. When the YM2151 counter reaches zero, it asserts a line connected to the z80 \icode{INT} line which makes the CPU jumps to address \icode{0x38}.

\lstinputlisting[style=CStyle]{src/code/z80/interrupts.c}

Function \icode{schedInterrupt} writes MSB 8-bit \icode{0xC0} and LSB \icode{0x00}. Notice how before writing to the YM2151 register the z80 makes sure the 2151 is not busy via \icode{waitYM2151()}.





\subsection{Initializing variables}
To finish bootstrapping, \icode{crt0} makes sure initialized C variables values are set. The linker placed all values requiring initialization in a \icode{\_GSINIT} segment. By wrapping it with markers \icode{\_INITIALIZER} (src) and \icode{\_INITIALIZED} (dst), they can be copied.

\lstinputlisting[style=Z80Style]{src/code/z80/initVar.s}

Copying is done with \icode{ldir} instruction using the linker macros, \icode{s\_} refers to the site of a segment and \icode{l\_} the length of that segment.

\lstinputlisting[style=Z80Style]{src/code/z80/copyvar.s}
 

% No initialization of BSS


\subsection{z80 Sound Driver}
A protocol using a stream (like Street Fighter 2 driver) yield more power but for the sake of readability a simpler approach is used here.



\lstinputlisting[style=CStyle]{src/code/z80/music.c}

The code presented here uses a single latch as "immediate value". If bit 0x80 is set, control is requesting a sound effect to be played, otherwise it is a music. 


The interrupt allows the main loop to tick once which does one of three things. It checks it is must wait, feed bytes to the YM2151 or feed soundID/channelID to the OKI.

\lstinputlisting[style=CStyle]{src/code/z80/driver.c}



\section{Back then...}\index{Back Then!SFX/Musics}
In the mid-80s, Capcom recognized the crucial importance of sound for a video-game and set to hire the very best musician they could find.

By 1989, they had assembled a pool of talent who called themselves the "Capcom Sound Team".

\img{capcom_sound_team.png}

The Capcom Sound team. L-R: Yoko Shimomura, Yoshihiro Sakaguchi, Manami Matsumae, Masaki Izumiya, Yasuaki Fujita, Mari Yamaguchi, Minae Fujii, Toshio Kajino, and Isao Abe. Identify of table-man is unknown.

\subsection{Recruiting}
Capcom actively recruited by taking advantage of 'careers days' to get graduates to come work for them. Many musicians came from music schools located in Kansai region (Kyoto, Osaka, Kobe) near Capcom headquarters. 

Several alumni of Osaka College of Music ended up working for Capcom where they were able to compose music for a living while having the security of working for a large Japanese company. 





One of these recruit, Yoko Shimomura, would go on to compose musics of games such as Street Fighter II, Final Fight, and Final Fantasy. Over the years she gave numerous interviews which help to paint a picture of the life of a musician working at Capcom.


\begin{q}{Yoko Shimomura, Street Fighter 2 music Composer\cite{beep199010}}

I studied piano in college, but I loved the Famicom, and would often stay up all night playing it. 

Then the next day my shoulders would be all stiff, and my piano teacher would scold me, and my Mom even said “I don’t remember raising a daughter like this.”

I decided that when I graduated, I would go work at a place where I could play both music and Famicom all day without complaints!
\end{q}


Yoko's account of her hiring interview confirm that Capcom was more interested in hiring talented musician than tech savvy people.

\begin{q}{Yoko Shimomura, Street Fighter 2 music Composer\cite{beep199010}}
  
I did not know you could write music with a computer until I joined the company. At the entrance exam, I was asked “what sequencer do you use?” and I had to ask back "What? Is that like an electronic controller?".

They had to teach me from the ground up, and after that it was less musical practice than it was technical. The first music data I turned in was thoroughly corrected, and I was feeling really glum.

I was asked to talk about what I knew about FM generation at the entrance exam. I had no idea what it was, so I thought about AM/FM radio and wrote down "it sounds better these days than it used to."
\end{q}



\subsection{Creative process}
Even though musicians were part of a "Sound Team", they usually worked alone on a game. 

If they could pick based on availabilities\cite{sf2musics}, they were assigned to the next project as soon as they were done with the previous one.


Being dropped on a project and asked to write music was difficult. It was mostly the planner's responsability to bried the musician on what kind of music they wanted\cite{sf2_music}.

\begin{q}{Yoko Shimomura, Street Fighter 2 music Composer\cite{sf2_oral_history}}
Mr. Nishitani would come up to me and show me designs of the characters and explain the personalities of the characters and ask me to make theme songs for each character.

I would look at the backgrounds and the character descriptions and all that, and I noticed that each character had a unique background. And because of that, I suggested making each theme song based on their background country and culture.
\end{q}

The work ethic of the composers had noting to envy to the artists drawing pixels.

\begin{q}{Yoko Shimomura, Street Fighter 2 music Composer\cite{sf2musicsecurity}}
At 11 o'clock, all the security was activated and you could not move between floors. The elevators stopped moving too. If you had to finish work by 7 o'clock the next day, we had to pass ROM down from the window on a string.

Once I tied a carrier bag and put the ROM inside and gave it to them. 15 mn later, the phone rang. They said "sorry but we broke the pins when we put it in! Can you give us another?"
\end{q}



\subsection{Tools}
Yoshihiro Sakaguchi, author of MegaMan musics, explain what computer they connected their Yamaha keyboard to.

\begin{q}{Yoshihiro Sakaguchi\cite{yoko_shimomura_interview}  }
We worked on both the music and sound effects for Capcom’s games. We’ve got a centralized recording system setup on a PC-98, so that even if we’re writing music for different hardware, we can compose without needing to be able to program.
\end{q}

\subsubsection{NEC PC-9800 series}\index{Computers!NEC PC-98}

NEC entered the personal computer market in 1979 with its 8800 series. These machine, build around 8-bit z80 CPUs would later be known as "PC-88". 

Thanks to its optional kanji ROM, NEC quickly gained traction The PC-88 accounted for 40\% of the Japanese personal market by 1981.

By the mid-80s, the aging series was discontinued in favor of machines based on 16-bit Intel CPUs. The first computer, named 9801, was be the first in the 9800 line. These machine were commonly referred to as "PC-98".

\begin{figure}[H]

\img{PC9800.jpg}
\caption*{PC-9801, the first in the 9800 series (1984)}
\end{figure}

Alike the PC-88, the PC-98 enjoyed considerable success. Over its lifespan ranging from 1992 to 2000, NEC sold more than 18 millions units. Across multiple lines such as "Desktop", "Hi-end", or "Laptop", NEC released a new machine every year\cite{9800lines}. 

The success was such that the series accounted for 60\% of the Japanese market Personnal Computer market in 1991. 



\subsubsection{Tech Specs}
Because so many models were released, it is hard to tell for sure which PC-98 was used for a particular game. What can be done is to list the models for each years CPS-1 games were released in order to get a rough idea.


\draw{pc98lines}

\subsubsection{C-bus and audio interface}

Despite their name, NEC's machine had nothing to do with the IBM PC. American firms actually had a hard time penetrating Japan market because of their lack of Kana and Kanji support.

From a tech specs perspective, the PC-98 uses its own 16-bit C-bus instead of the ISA bus; BIOS, I/O port addressing, memory management and graphics output are also different.

\img{roland_cbus.jpg}

\subsubsection{Video chip}
NEC was immensely succesful.

Due to the language barrier, Big Blue's machines never managed to break into the Japanese market.

The PC-98s supported kanjis and had their own C-Bus, BIOS, I/O port addressing, memory management, and graphics system. 

Although having specs far inferior to the Fujitsu FM Towns and Sharp X68000, NEC enjoyed tremendous success, selling 18 millions units from 1982 to 1999.






\begin{trivia}
When it came to record voices, the whole Street Fighter II development team was encouraged to contribute.

\begin{q}{VGDensetsu\cite{sf2samples}  }
Chun-Li Spinning Bird Kick line was spoken by Eri Nakamura, the graphic designer in charge of Honda, while a background designer did her victory cry ("Kyahahaha! Yattaaa") and a third person recorded another line.

For Ryu and Ken, who share the same voice, the graphic designer in charge of Guile lent his voice for the Hadoken and Shoryuken while the one in charge of Boxer did the Tatsumaki Senpukyaku.  
\end{q}
\end{trivia}

\subsubsection{The end of PC-98}
List of games only accounts for 1,228 titles. Despite inferio hardware capabilities compared to Fujitsu's FM Tower or Sharp's X68000 steady stream of games and huge share of the market. Game developers favorite.

NEC's domination only started to wade with DOS/V, a special version of Microsoft's MS-DOS supporting Japanese characters, came out at the end of 1990.
